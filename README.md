my 3rd task for my graphic design internship at SkillCraft Technology.
I had the opportunity to design a business card, for which i came up with- The Noble Alchemy, a fictional luxury perfume brand. The aim was to embody elegance and sophistication, reflecting the essence of the brand.
Using inspiration from existing luxury brands, I crafted a minimalist design that captures the allure of high-end fragrances and gives off a Desi-vibe. I'm looking forward to gaining insights from this experience.
On to the next one!
